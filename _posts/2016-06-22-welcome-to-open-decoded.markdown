At Decoded Ltd we deliver digital training courses.

We've realised that although we frequently talk to our alumni about being able to use a lot of free, open-source software to their advantage, we rarely discuss that this relationship can work both ways too and that anyone with the time and inclination can give back to open-source projects too!

Over the years we've accumulated many different software projects and we've decided it's high time that we opened up some of these for the benefit of the wider community.

**This blog will be the place where we announce and explain each bit of tech that we choose to open-source.**

Some posts will be about short small snippets of cool code we've found to be very useful or interesting. Other posts will be about releases of whole software projects. We'll also have some posts going over how we've managed to solve some of our problems integrating various SAAS solutions with custom logic we've needed.
